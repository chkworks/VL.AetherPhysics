A VVVV Gamma Library based on https://github.com/nkast/Aether.Physics2D/releases

This is work in progress in a very early stage, stuff will change a lot very likely until its more mature
A lot of functionality is not there or incomplete, and also concepts/patterns probably change.
despite this, a lot of things allready work and you can allready build some nice things and play around with it. 


***Installation***

Use VVVV Gamma Launcher-> 
Tick "Use Repos"
Go to "Settings" tab -> "Package repositiories" -> "+" ->  Add this folder
Start Gamma from the launcher
